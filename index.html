            1.The HTML <span> tag is really powerful when it comes to apply different style
            on some part of your text content marked up with a single element.
            And when you have multiple span tags, you need to apply different class names
            in order to be able to select them in the stylesheet.
            2. Following are the most common and practical example on using <span> tag to apply different style
               to some part of your text content
        -->

    <header>
      <!--
            1. This will wrap the word 'Span' with span tag and apply class name 'red'.
            2. Now we can apply different style to only this word 'Span' in this title
            3. We can select it with its class name: red in the stylesheet and apply different style rules
            4. Check the css codes in the style.css file
        -->
      <h1><span class="red">Span</span> Tag Example</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
      <h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
      <!--
            1. This will wrap five different words in this paragraph using <span> tag.
            2. And apply different class name to each, such as: blue, green, purple, orange, pink
            3. Now we can select each span tag with its class name and apply different style to each word in it
            4. Check the css codes in the style.css file
        -->
      <p>
        Lorem Ipsum is <span class="blue">simply</span> dummy text of the
        printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
        standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a
        <span class="green">galley</span> of type and scrambled it to make
        a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also
        the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
        It was <span class="purple">popularised</span> in the
        <span class="orange">1960s</span> with the release of Letraset sheets
        containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
        publishing software like
        <span class="pink">Aldus PageMaker</span> including versions of Lorem
        Ipsum.
      </p>

      <!--
            1. Sometime you can even select one or more characters of the word and apply different style to it 
            2. This will wrap one or more character in each word with span tag
            3. And apply different class name to each, such as: one, two, three, middle, last
            4. Now we can select each span tag with its class name and apply different style to characters in it
            4. Check the css codes in the style.css file
        -->
      <p>
        <span class="one">L</span>orem <span class="two">ip</span>sum <span class="three">dol</span>or
        s<span class="middle">i</span class="last">t ame<span>t</span>.
